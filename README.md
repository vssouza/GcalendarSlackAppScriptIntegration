# GcalendarSlackAppScriptIntegration

## sendOKREventSlackFromGCal

sendOKREventSlackFromGCal.js contains an example to read content from different callendars and post them to a slack channel. This example comes handy since Google retired the Google Calendar for Team Events plugin. They recommend to use the new Google Calendar integration plugin that currently doesn't allow to post automatically into channels with other members.

## Requirements
To use this function you need:

- Google Calendar
- Google App Script Account
- Slack Workspace
- Webhook configuration permissions (or a webhook available for you)

## About This
This function is used as code in the article:

[How get reminders of your OKR Events with a Slack/Google Calendar integration](https://medium.com/@vs.souza/how-get-reminders-of-your-okr-events-with-a-slack-google-calendar-integration-98ded0a33a1f)

Hopefully this is a temporary workaround while Google doesn't release a permanent and more elegant solution.
